/*
In Spanish, sentences not only end with exclamation and question marks, but also begin with them (actually flipped over version).

It looks like:

¿Cómo estás?      -> How are you?
¡Es maravilloso!  -> It is wonderful!
Keeping in mind only the above-mentioned fact, your task is to find out how many sentences in unput array are "spanish" and return '¡n spanish sentence(s) here and hasta la vista, baby!'

For example:

spanishSent(['How are you?', '¿How are you?',  'It is you', '¡It is you', '¡You are hot!'])  -> '¡2 spanish sentences here and hasta la vista, baby!'

spanishSent(['¿How are you', '¿How are you?', '!It is me', 'You are.'])  -> '¡1 spanish sentence here and hasta la vista, baby!'
P.S. Array's length > 0.

//My Solution

function spanishSent(arr) {
    const count = arr.filter(
        (item) =>
          (item[0] === '¿' && item[item.length - 1] === '?') ||
          (item[0] === '¡' && item[item.length - 1] === '!')
      ).length;
    const sentence = (count > 1 || count === 0) ? 'sentences' : 'sentence';
    
    return `¡${count} spanish ${sentence} here and hasta la vista, baby!`;
}
